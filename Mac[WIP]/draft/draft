objectives:
	- texture mapping
	- sound
	- save/load game state
	- game balance
	- bump mapping
	- picking/draging
	- procedually generated structals (building, upgrade)
	- dynamic surface?
	- buildings on non-plain surface
	- lighting (time-based, weather?, moon light, structals' lights)
	- shadow
	- 2D game status hub
	- loading screen
	- front screen
	- event loop (event handling)
	- science/histroy

plan (~17 days):
	- improve cs488-framework (~3d)
		- control flows
			- custom(game/music/IO) events
			- pasuing
			- limiting FPS
		- window 
			- resize
			- debug panel
		- model loading
			- more supported formats
	- rendering (~5d)
		- vertex bufferring
		- transformation bufferring
		- observsor pattern, only change the update vertex
		- rewrite shader
			- multiple light source
				- time-based light source
				- light source on models
			- shadow
			- texture mapping
			- selection highlight
			- fog
			- bump mapping
				- smoothing terrian
		- sky-box
			- procedurally generated stars
			- reloaded sky-box background
		- seperated thread, UI thread/game control thread
	- game control (~4d)
		- map grid (observsor)
			- pre-defined
			- dynamically generated (slope of mountain)
			- selection (picking)
			- building size
		- player control
			- mouse
				- camera rotation/translation
				- picking
				- dragging
			- keyboard
				- shortcut
		- game save
			- save file format
			- loading/saving
		- timer
			- in game event
				- random encounters
			- sun sets/rises
	- 2D hub (~1d)
		- text display
		- picking building
		- info panel
	- game menu (~0.5d)
		- loading screen
	- 3D models (~1d)
		- procedurally gerenated models
	- game balance/testing (~1d)
	- animation (~1d)
		- frame based, pre-defined
	- more game balance/testing (~?d)
